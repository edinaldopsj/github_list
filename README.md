# Some notes about the task!


Thank you so much for having my test and for your time,
 
Firstly, you only need a githubToken to make requests for the GraphQL API
 
Secondly and unfortunately, I wasn't able to properly sortBy using the GraphQL API
because I honestly don't understand very much of it
Anyway, I tried to show a manual sorting just in case it could be accepted
 
Hope that suffices and I'm open to any questions!
Have a great day!
 
Best Regards
 
Edinaldo
